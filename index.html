                    <p align = "justify">This Project presents a new meme token SharkToshi “Satoshi’s Version of SharkTank” A very simple idea how would Satoshi Nakamoto raise funds to develop a robust blockchain. Nowadays crypto industry is exponentially growing by introducing new ideas to public and transferring power to communities. In 2013 a cryptocurrency Doge created by two software engineers, who decided to create a payment system as a “joke” making fun of the wild speculation in crypto industry at that time. In 2020 a meme revolution came into existence when a new token Shina Inu was introduced to crypto industry. Nowadays meme token is a trend in crypto industry and we are introducing you “SharkToshi” A community driven blockchain version of SharkTank with fair distribution and availability for all crypto communities. In future based on SharkToshi progress a blockchain will be introduced on the technical basis of Solana Hybrid Proof of History (PoH) - a Proof for verifying orders and History between events alongside with consensus algorithm Proof of Stake (PoS).

                        <p align = "justify">: As the name sounds Satoshi’s Version of SharkTank “SharkToshi” is a first meme token on TomoChain network to honor Satoshi Nakamoto for incepting the great idea of peer to peer transactions to decentralize the economy. Shark Token is listed on LuaSwap DeX. This token is the first of it’s kind on TomoChain and LuaSwap purely run by its community. We only have one contract address on Tomochain <a href="https://tomoscan.io/token/0x8865280c31B8CBC7b96cE48Ad52C122E6D82806a">0x8865280c31B8CBC7b96cE48Ad52C122E6D82806a</a> Nowadays it’s easy to create a token on any chain so beware of fake contracts. We do not tax our buyers and sellers only LP fee of 0.4% will be charged for each buy and sell keeping no restriction on any buyer and seller. In future based on the progress of this meme project a blockchain will be build on the technical basis of Solana Hybrid Proof of History (PoH) - a Proof for verifying orders and History between events alongside with consensus algorithm Proof of Stake (PoS).</p>

                        <p align = "justify">How To Buy Shark Tokens: Download MetaMask or TrustWallet (From the official Source). Connect the wallet with the TomoChain Network and transfer some Tomo Coins to the wallet and connect the wallet with the LuaSwap Dex and enter the SharkToshi Contract address and Swap the Tomo for Shark Tokens. </p>
                        <p align ="justify">Why TomoChain: TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. TomoChain relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support near-zero fee, and 2-second transaction confirmation time. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and "true" randomization processes. TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into TomoChain's Masternode architecture which will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integration for small and big businesses.

                        LuaSwap: LuaSwap is the new swap protocol inspired by the previous AMM-based swap protocols such as Uniswap and SushiSwap. However, LuaSwap’s redesigned tokeneonomics and operation strategy addresses the short-comings of other swap systems. At the core, LuaSwap delivers a community-governed, multichain protocol via the LUA token. The focus is to support smaller pools of emerging tokens instead of fighting for liquidity within the top token pools. LuaSwap is a Multi-Chain liquidity exchange protocol with fee structure 0.4% for each Swap out of which 0.35% is added to liquidity providers.

                       A total of one time fixed  21 Billion Tokens have been minted during the contract Deployment ( <a href="https://github.com/SharkChain/SharkChain">Contract Code Available on GitHub</a> ). A total of 11 billion tokens have been burned, 9 billion locked in LuaSwap Liquidity Pool and 1 Billion tokens have been kept for Airdrop,Marketing,Advertising etc. Initially the tokens were Airdropped to Tomo and Lua  holders with some restrictions and now the tokens will be airdropped via CoinMarketCap Company after the listing of Sharktoshi token on CMC.
